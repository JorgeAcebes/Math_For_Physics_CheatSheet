Whenever I can, I will be adding new sections but I will NOT be updating the mani.tex. 
In order to include the new sections into the file you just have to write: \import{sections/}{name_of_section} in the main.tex, where the others "\import" are located.

I recommend including all the new sections after "integrals" so that the text fill up the least space possible.
