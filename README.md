Whenever I can, I will be adding new sections, but I will NOT be updating the main.tex.
To include the new sections, simply add: \import{sections/}{name_of_section} in the main.tex file, where the other \import lines are located.

I recommend placing all new sections after "integrals" so that the content takes up as little space as possible.

If you find any mistakes, please open an issue in the Issues tab — I’ll fix them as soon as possible.
